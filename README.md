This project is a text based python pygame. The game displays four golf club options that can hit the ball a specific distance within a range. The hole is 100 yards away. When a club is selected, a random number between the club's range is picked and the ball travels that distance towards the hole. The game is won when the user is 0 yards away from the hole.
